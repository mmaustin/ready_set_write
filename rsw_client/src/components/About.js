      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing is not a passive endeavor; it is mental exercise.
        Before any exercise, one must warm up. Ready Set Write&nbsp; was created with this in mind. Oftentimes,
        the most difficult thing about writing is getting started. RSW was designed
        to help writers of all ablilities block out distractions and focus their minds. Simply enter your desired number of minutes,
        click the countdown button, and start writing. My studies have found that the coupling of time pressure 
        and instant display of product increases one&#39;s
        focus exponentially. Give&nbsp; it a try for yourself!
