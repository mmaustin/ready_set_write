      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of writing as an exercise, an activity. Before any activity, one must warm up. Enter, Ready Set Write. Often &nbsp;
        the most difficult thing about writing is simply getting &nbsp; started.  RSW was designed
        to help writers of all ablilities to block out distractions and focus their minds onto the challenge
        that is writing. Simply enter your desired number &nbsp; of minutes, click the countdown button, and 
        start writing. &nbsp; My studies have found that the coupling of time pressure &nbsp; and instant display of product increases one&#39;s
        focus exponentially. Give it a try for yourself!
